Vencord Stuff, and Things(s)?

<br>
I *hate* that mf gift button, I always accidentally click it instead of the emoji picker. Now I've sent it to the shadow realm...

<a href=https://github.com/Cats1337/BetterDiscord/blob/main/Declutter.css>**Discord UI Tweaks**</a>:
<br>
Various Discord UI tweaks to declutter the UI and remove unwanted elements.

<a href=https://github.com/Cats1337/BetterDiscord/blob/main/SemiFixIcons.css>**Semi Fix Icons**</a>:
<br>
Fix SOME of the ULGY new icons. 
This is a continuation/revamp/whatever of https://github.com/MrDiamondDog/noUglyIconsTheme, which was deprecated and continued by me, then I didn't really care enough to update parts of it so now it's whatever I want to fix... (basically anything not hidden by my Declutter)
